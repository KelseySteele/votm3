Although almost all users capturing video from the field already have a camera and laptop, these solutions often require the user to add another heavy boxorbackpack, or they are very expensive services, or lock the user to a set of carrier services or specific IP network(s),or require the user to pass their captured video first through the vendors service center before it is sent back to the user&#39s own central hub, or require viewers to download a plug-in or all of the above problems. KenCast&#39s solution avoids all of these problems. The Vazzt solution is:</p><ul><li>All-software based &#45 NO HARDWARE REQUIRED</li><li>Playback on any user device without KenCast software/plugins &#45 NOTHING required from KenCast </li><li>Agnostic to wireless IP Services and allows the user to employ &#39any&#39 wireless IP networks of his/her own choice and to change them as often as he/she chooses, or finds it necessary, and to do so immediately/on-the-fly</li><li>Amenable to a new IP network service as soon as it is available</li><li>Ready to support an enterprise that wants to set up its own complete wireless video capture capability, from the field to its own central hub, with full security on the streaming video and on the files, without passing captured video through any third party.

The camera/laptop can be very simple and inexpensive for standard IPTV, but expensive for a full HD IPTV configuration. Vazzt Capture Software will automatically read the default video resolutions available from the camera you attach to the laptop/computer with the Vazzt Capture Server software.  It will present these options to you.  Typical options include the following and can be used in these typical setups:</p><ul><li>(320x240) For the Capture Server use a netbook with built in webcam, subscribe to 2 carrier wireless data services at $60 per month each ($120/month).  There is no other recurring cost for the capture server operation.  You can also bond together WiFi and other IP network services, when available, with the 2 carrier services to get higher resolution, but webcams do not yet have higher resolution capability.</li><li>(720x480) Use a laptop for Capture Server with a prosumer camera and 3 carrier wireless data services for only about $180/month recurring cost. </li><li>(1440x1080) Use a good laptop for Capture Server with a pro camera and 6-7 carrier 3G wireless data services for excellent bandwidth for about $360/month recurring cost.</li></ul><p>However, at this upper resolution you can also use multiple new carrier IP Networks (LTE and/or WiMAX) to get enough bandwidth to support this quality resolution √ê in the range of 2.5-4.5 Mbps).  Currently you may need a server-class computer and a broadband wire connection to the Internet to use the Vazzt Capture Server software at this resolution, until multiple 4G networks are available to be bonded together.</p>"},{category:"general",number:"5",question:"Resolution Available for Coverage with the Vazzt VOTM Service",answer:'<p>When using the Vazzt VOTM Service, the resolution you select will depend on the amount of bandwidth detected by the VazztCaster program and the options that the Vazzt VazztCaster program automatically detects in your camera. </p><p>There are 4 types of cameras on the market today: HD cameras; HDV Cameras; DV Cameras; and Webcams.

Vazzt can be dynamically reconfigured for varying local IP Network coverage.  And such enterprises of necessity cannot always allow their content to pass through a commercial vendor or a public commercial service offering (for example, surveillance video).  Because the user need only obtain Vazzt software, and can employ their own laptops, commercial IP network services, and central hub computer equipment on Internet access lines, the only remaining requirement might be additional IP network services.
